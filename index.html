                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <p class="faq-question">How do I create a new habit?</p>
                    <p class="faq-answer">Tap the "+" button in the top right corner of the Habits tab. Enter your habit name, choose an emoji icon, and set your goal (number of days). Tap "Add" to create your habit.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <p class="faq-question">How do I mark a habit as complete?</p>
                    <p class="faq-answer">Simply tap the circle button on the right side of any habit card. A green checkmark will appear to indicate completion. You can also tap any day in the weekly calendar view to toggle it.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <p class="faq-question">Can I mark past days as complete?</p>
                    <p class="faq-answer">Yes! Tap the pencil icon on any habit to open the edit view. You'll see a full monthly calendar where you can tap any day (after your habit start date) to mark it complete or incomplete.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <p class="faq-question">What do the colors mean on the calendar?</p>
                    <p class="faq-answer">Green indicates completed days, red indicates missed days (days you could have completed but didn't), and gray indicates days before you created the habit or future days. A star badge marks the day you started the habit.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <p class="faq-question">How are streaks calculated?</p>
                    <p class="faq-answer">Your current streak counts consecutive days of completion, starting from today (or yesterday if you haven't completed today yet) and going backwards. Missing a day breaks your streak, but you can go back and fill in missed days to restore it.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <p class="faq-question">How do I set up daily reminders?</p>
                    <p class="faq-answer">Go to Settings tab, enable "Morning Reminder", and set your preferred time. You'll receive a daily notification to remind you to work on your habits.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <p class="faq-question">Is my data backed up?</p>
                    <p class="faq-answer">Your data is stored locally on your device. If you have iCloud Backup enabled for your device, your app data will be included in your device backups. We recommend keeping device backups enabled.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <p class="faq-question">How do I delete a habit?</p>
                    <p class="faq-answer">Tap the pencil icon on the habit card to open edit view, then scroll down and tap "Delete Habit". Confirm to permanently remove the habit and all its data.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <p class="faq-question">Can I change the app's accent color?</p>
                    <p class="faq-answer">Yes! Go to Settings, find the Appearance section, and tap on any color circle to change the accent color throughout the app.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <p class="faq-question">How do achievements work?</p>
                    <p class="faq-answer">You earn achievements by completing habits and staying active. There are two tracks: "Habits Completed" (based on total completions) and "Days Active" (based on unique days with activity). Each achievement has Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, and Diamond tiers with progress bars showing how close you are to each one.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <p class="faq-question">What happens if I delete the app?</p>
                    <p class="faq-answer">Deleting the app will permanently remove all your habit data, journal entries, and settings from your device. This cannot be undone unless you have a device backup.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <p class="faq-question">Does the app work offline?</p>
                    <p class="faq-answer">Yes! HabitGoals works completely offline. All data is stored locally on your device, so you don't need an internet connection to track your habits.</p>
